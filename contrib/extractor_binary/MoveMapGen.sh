## Syntax of this helper
## First param must be number of to be used CPUs (only 1, 2, 3, 4 supported) or "offmesh" to recreate the special tiles from the OFFMESH_FILE
## Second param can be an additional filename for storing log
## Third param can be an addition filename for storing detailed log

## Additional Parameters to be forwarded to MoveMapGen, see mmaps/readme for instructions
PARAMS="--silent"

## Already a few map extracted, and don't care anymore
EXCLUDE_MAPS=""
#EXCLUDE_MAPS="0 1 530 571" # example to exclude the continents

## Offmesh file
OFFMESH_FILE="offmesh.txt"

## Normal log file (if not overwritten by second param
LOG_FILE="MoveMapGen.log"
## Detailed log file
DETAIL_LOG_FILE="MoveMapGen_detailed.log"

## ! Use below only for finetuning or if you know what you are doing !
